- 👋 Hi, I'm [@ArafatrahmanSQA](https://github.com/ArafatrahmanSQA).
- 👀 I'm interested in software quality assurance (SQA) and testing, especially in the field of web and mobile app testing.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning about test automation frameworks like cypress.io and selenium to enhance my testing skills. Also, I have knowledge of Front-End and Back-End testing.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on open-source testing projects and contribute to the testing community by sharing my knowledge and experience.
- 📫 You can reach me through my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arafatrahman9/) for professional networking and discussions.
